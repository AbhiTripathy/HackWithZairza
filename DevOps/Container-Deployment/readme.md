# Container & Deployment

This folder contains containerization and deployment automation projects using Docker and CI/CD tools. Projects are organized by complexity, from basic container configurations to production-ready deployment pipelines.

## Project Levels

### Level 1: Simple Dockerfiles
Basic Docker container configurations for different technology stacks including Node.js, Python, and Java applications. Focus on understanding container fundamentals and image building.

**Skills:** Dockerfile syntax, image layers, build optimization, port mapping, environment variables

### Level 2: Docker Compose Configurations
Multi-container applications using Docker Compose. Projects include full-stack applications with databases, caching layers, and networking between containers.

**Skills:** Service orchestration, networking, volumes, environment configuration, container dependencies

### Level 3: GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows
Automated testing and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions. Projects include continuous integration pipelines with automated testing, building, and deployment triggers.

**Skills:** YAML workflows, CI/CD concepts, automated testing, deployment automation, GitHub Actions syntax

### Level 4: Complete Deployment Pipelines
Production-ready deployment pipelines with monitoring, logging, and alerting. Projects integrate multiple tools for comprehensive DevOps automation.

**Skills:** Production deployments, monitoring setup, logging aggregation, health checks, rollback strategies
