# Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains AI and machine learning projects focusing on generative AI applications. Each folder will contain implementations leveraging modern large language models for practical use cases.

## Folders Overview

### 1. Generative AI
This folder will contain projects using large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI APIs. Projects range from prompt engineering and API integration to building AI-powered applications with text and image processing capabilities. Each level progressively introduces API usage, CLI tool development, and multi-modal implementations.

- Files:
  - `ProjectName_YourGitHubUsername/` (folder containing source code and documentation)
  - Include API setup instructions and example outputs

## How to Submit

1. Navigate to the appropriate project level.
2. Create a folder with your implementation following the naming convention: `ProjectName_YourGitHubUsername/`
3. Include all source files, setup instructions, and example usage.
4. Add `.env.example` file for API key templates.
5. Submit a pull request with your project.

Each project level contains a `readme.md` file with detailed requirements, implementation guidelines, learning resources, and API documentation links.
