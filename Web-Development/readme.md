# Web Development

This repository contains web development projects focusing on modern frontend and backend technologies. Each folder will contain project implementations and resources for building practical web applications.

## Folders Overview

### 1. Browser Extensions
This folder will contain browser extension projects for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Extensions range from simple utility tools to complex productivity applications with API integrations.

Projects progress from basic mock APIs to production-ready services with authentication, database integration, and comprehensive documentation. Each level builds upon previous concepts to develop full-stack API development skills.
