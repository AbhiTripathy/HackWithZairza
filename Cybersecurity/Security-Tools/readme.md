# Security Tools & Demos

This folder contains security tools and educational demonstrations of vulnerabilities. All projects are intended strictly for educational purposes and must include ethical use guidelines.

## Project Levels

### Level 1: Password Tools
Basic password security utilities including strength checkers and secure password generators. Focus on understanding password security fundamentals and best practices.

**Skills:** Random generation, entropy calculation, strength validation, secure storage principles

### Level 2: Basic Encryption/Decryption
Implementations of common encryption algorithms and ciphers. Learn cryptographic fundamentals through practical coding exercises.

**Skills:** Cryptographic algorithms, symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, encoding

### Level 3: Vulnerability Demos
Educational demonstrations of common web vulnerabilities in controlled environments. Understand attack vectors to build better defenses.

**Skills:** Web security, input validation, SQL injection, XSS prevention, ethical hacking

### Level 4: Security Audit Tools
Tools for security assessment and vulnerability scanning. Implement comprehensive security checklists and automated audit systems.

**Skills:** Security assessment, vulnerability scanning, compliance checking, report generation

## Prerequisites

- Programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Basic understanding of security concepts
- Command-line proficiency
