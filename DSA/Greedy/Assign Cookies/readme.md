## Problem 1: Assign Cookies
Assume you are a parent trying to give cookies to your children. Each child has a greed factor, and each cookie has a size. A child will be content only if the cookie size is greater than or equal to their greed factor. Maximize the number of content children.

### Example:
```
Input: greedFactor = [1,2,3], cookieSize = [1,1]
Output: 1
```
Explanation: Only one child can be satisfied.


### Constraints:
- `1 <= greedFactor.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= cookieSize.length <= 3 * 10^4`
