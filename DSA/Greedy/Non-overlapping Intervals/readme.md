## Problem 5: Non-overlapping Intervals
Given an array of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

### Example:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
```
Explanation: Remove [1,3] to make the rest non-overlapping.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
