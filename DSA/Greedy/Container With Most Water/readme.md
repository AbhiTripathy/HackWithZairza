## Problem 4: Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of line i are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that contains the most water.

### Example:
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```
Explanation: The maximum area is between index 1 and 8.


### Constraints:
- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
