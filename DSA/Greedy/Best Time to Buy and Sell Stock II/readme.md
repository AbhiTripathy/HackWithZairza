## Problem 2: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on the i-th day. You can buy and sell multiple times. Find the maximum profit you can achieve.

### Example:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
```
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 3.
Total profit = 7.


### Constraints:
- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`
