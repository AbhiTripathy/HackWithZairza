## Problem 5: Partition Equal Subset Sum
Given an integer array nums, return true if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
```
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].


### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
