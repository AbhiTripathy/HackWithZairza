## Problem 2: Coin Change
You are given an integer array coins representing different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money. Return the fewest number of coins needed to make up that amount. If that amount cannot be made up, return -1.

### Example:
```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
```
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1


### Constraints:
- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 10^4`
