## Problem 4: Sliding Window Maximum
You are given an array of integers nums and a sliding window of size k. Return the maximum value in each window as it moves from left to right.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
