## Problem 5: Decode String
Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside brackets is repeated exactly k times.

### Example:
```
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"

Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 30`
