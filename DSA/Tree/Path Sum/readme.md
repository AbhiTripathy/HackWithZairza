## Problem 6: Path Sum
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all values equals targetSum.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
```
Explanation: The path 5->4->11->2 sums to 22.

### Constraints:
- `Number of nodes: [5000]`
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
