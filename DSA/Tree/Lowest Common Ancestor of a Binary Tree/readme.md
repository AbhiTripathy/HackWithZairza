## Problem 3: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree. The LCA is the deepest node that is an ancestor of both nodes.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
```
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

### Constraints:
- `Number of nodes: [2, 10^5]`
