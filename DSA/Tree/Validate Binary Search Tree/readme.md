## Problem 5: Validate Binary Search Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). A valid BST has all left descendants less than the node and all right descendants greater than the node.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- `Number of nodes: [1, 10^4]`
