## Problem 4: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Example:
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

### Constraints:
- `Number of nodes: [2000]`
